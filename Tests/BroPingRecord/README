BroPingRecord Test Application

You can use this application to test BroccoliSharp with the standard
Broccoli API "broping-record.bro" testing script. You will first need to
build the BroccoliSharp library before testing - see the root README for
more info.

To test the application, first run the Bro script from a terminal session:

	bro broping-record.bro

Note that the "bro" application may not be in your path - it is commonly
installed at "/usr/local/bro/bin". You may need to add this to your
path or run the program directly from this folder.

Next, run the BroccoliSharp application from a second terminal session:

	mono BroPing.exe 127.0.0.1:47758

If there is a type initializer exception when starting the application
in the BroccoliSharp.Internal.BroApi, this indicates that the Broccoli
API shared library, libbroccoli.so, cannot be located. To fix this you
can either update the ld.so.conf with the Bro library path (then apply
the updates using ldconfig) or simply set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the
path. The Broccoli library is commonly installed at "/usr/local/bro/lib",
as an example, you could assign the LINUX library path like so:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/bro/lib
