BroccoliSharp: A .NET implementation of the Bro Client Communications Library.

BroccoliSharp is a set of managed C# based .NET classes and structures that wrap Broccoli, the "Bro client communications library". This library fully implements the Broccoli API and will allow you to create client sensors for the Bro intrusion detection system, receive Bro IDs, send and receive Bro events, as well as send and receive event requests to and from peering Bros. As in the native C Broccoli API, you can currently create and receive values of pure types like integers, counters, timestamps, IP addresses, port numbers, booleans, and strings. 

BroccoliSharp is free software under terms of the BSD license as provided in the LICENSE file distributed with the source code. 

More details on BroccoliSharp usage can be found in the documentation related to the primary data structures. It is expected that the developer is already familiar with basic Bro concepts before using the BroccoliSharp library. 
 
Installation

    The BroccoliSharp library has only been tested on Linux so far. 

Prerequisites

    BroccoliSharp requires the following libraries which need to be installed
    before you begin: 

    * The Broccoli library (of course!), Broccoli has its own requirements.
    * Mono – version supporting.NET 4.5 is preferred but may not be required. 

Building BroccoliSharp

To build the BroccoliSharp library using Mono you can use xbuild: 

    xbuild /p:Configuration=Release BroccoliSharp.sln

To build BroccoliSharp to work with a Broccoli release that has disabled PCAP support, use: 

    xbuild /p:Configuration=ReleaseNoPCAP BroccoliSharp.sln

You can also build the library on Windows using Visual Studio, however the binaries built on Windows will only work on Linux if the Mono release at least supports .NET 4.5. 

Once the BroccoliSharp.dll exists (found in Build/Output/Release folder relative to solution) you can add a reference to the library in your .NET projects and begin using BroccoliSharp.
