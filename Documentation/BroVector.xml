      <h2>Handling Vectors</h2>
      The functionality of a <see cref="BroVector"/> is virtually identical to that of a .NET
      <see cref="List{T}"/> with a type implementation of a <see cref="BroValue"/>.
    </para>
  </remarks>
  <threadsafety>
    Implementation of <see cref="BroVector"/> is not synchronized, as a result, enumerating through
    the vector will intrinsically not be a thread-safe procedure. In cases where enumeration contends
    with write accesses, vector should be locked during the entire enumeration. To allow the vector
    to be accessed by multiple threads for reading and writing, synchronization will be required.
