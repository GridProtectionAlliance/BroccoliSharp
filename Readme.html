    <h1>BroccoliSharp: A .NET implementation of the Bro Client Communications Library.</h1>

    <p>
        BroccoliSharp is a set of managed C# based .NET classes and structures that wrap
        Broccoli, the "Bro client communications library". This library fully implements
        the Broccoli API and will allow you to create client sensors for the Bro intrusion
        detection system, receive Bro IDs, send and receive Bro events, as well as send
        and receive event requests to and from peering Bros. As in the native C Broccoli
        API, you can currently create and receive values of pure types like integers,
        counters, timestamps, IP addresses, port numbers, booleans, and strings.
    </p>

    <p>
        BroccoliSharp is free software under terms of the BSD license as provided in the
        LICENSE.txt file distributed with the source code.
    </p>

    <p>
        More details on BroccoliSharp usage can be found in the documentation related to
        the primary data structures. It is expected that the developer is already familiar
        with basic Bro concepts before using the BroccoliSharp library.

        This document describes BroccoliSharp 1.0.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
        The BroccoliSharp library
        has only been tested on Linux so far.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>
        BroccoliSharp requires the following
        libraries which need to be installed before you begin:
    </p>

    <p style='text-indent: .5in'>
        <span style='font-family: Symbol'>·&#160;</span>&#160;        
        <a href="https://www.bro.org/download/">The Broccoli library</a>
        (of course!), Broccoli has its own requirements, see
        <a href="https://www.bro.org/sphinx/components/broccoli/README.html">docs</a>.
    </p>

    <p style='text-indent: .5in'>
        <span style='font-family: Symbol'>·&#160;</span>&#160;
        <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin">Mono</a> –
        version supporting.NET 4.5 is preferred but may not be required.
    </p>

    <h3>Building BroccoliSharp</h3>

    <p>
        To build the BroccoliSharp library using Mono you can use xbuild:
    </p>

    <p style='text-indent: .5in'>
        xbuild /p:Configuration=Release BroccoliSharp.sln
    </p>

    <p>
        To build BroccoliSharp to work with a Broccoli release that has disabled PCAP support, use:
    </p>

    <p style='text-indent: .5in'>
        xbuild /p:Configuration=ReleaseNoPCAP BroccoliSharp.sln
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also build the library on Windows using Visual Studio, however the binaries built on Windows
        will only work on Linux if the Mono release at least supports .NET 4.5.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the BroccoliSharp.dll exists (found in Build/Output/Release folder relative to solution) you can
        add a reference to the library in your .NET projects and begin using BroccoliSharp.
    </p>

    <h3>About the Code</h3>
    
    <p>
        When building inside Visual Studio code analysis is enabled for this project. A rule set is included
        with the source code (i.e., BroccoliSharp.ruleset) that defines the analysis rules that are enabled for
        the project. Note that this rule set is basically just the "Microsoft Managed Recommended Rules" with
        one rule turned off: CA1060: Move P/Invokes to NativeMethods class. This rule wants to force the name
        of the imported Bro API functions class to be "NativeMethods", but I prefer "BroAPI" for this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code has also been through extensive analysis using the 
        <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/tools+libraries/tools/gendarme/">Gendarme</a> tool. All
        items it reports have been reviewed thoroughly - there are no issues of concern. A future to-do could
        be to create an exclusion list with justifications.
